USERS MANUAL

Steps:

1. Select the midtones (Select>Color_range>Midtones) and do some curve adjustments on the green and blue channels to make the selected area pop
2. Select>Select_and_Mask>Feather (to your liking, around 30-110)
2. Run the Action set
3. Selective Color Adjustments to get the right colors
4. Enjoy your SHO image :)


Some Tips:
 - Do some stretching before running the action, so you can see the results better
 - Use starless images
 - Make sure your image is already in 16 Bits/Channel
 - Works better on good SNR images, because adjusting the midtones might add some noise to the selected area and make it look grainy
 - Make sure the image is gradient free to get better results
 - Works with regular DSLR but a modified one or an astro dedicated camera with a dual-narrowband filter will increase the quality
